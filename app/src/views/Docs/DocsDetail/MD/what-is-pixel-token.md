# What is Pixel token ($PIXL)?

Pixel token ($PIXL) is a rewards token for purchasing atomic assets on the marketplace. When you buy atomic assets via BazAR or any UCM, you become eligible to receive $PIXL tokens. BazAR tracks buying streaks which occur when users buy one or more atomic assets on consecutive days. The longer the streak, the more $PIXL you earn.

User's reward share weight starts at one, and each additional day of the streak the $PIXL reward share increases by 0.1 with a max value of 4.

**Disclaimer: $PIXL is a fun reward designed to incentivize discovery and interaction with atomic assets, and does not necessarily have financial value.**
