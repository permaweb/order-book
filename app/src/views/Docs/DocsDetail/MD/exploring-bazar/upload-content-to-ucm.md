# Uploading Content to BazAR (UCM)

As BazAR serves as a user interface for the UCM protocol, there are multiple methods to upload content to UCM and trade on BazAR.

Content can be uploaded from:

- [Atomic asset collection uploader](https://atomicasset.arweave.dev/#/collection-create)
- [Akord Mint](https://mint.akord.com/login)
- [Fair Protocol AI generated art](https://fair.arweave.dev/) 
- [Alex. Archive Artifact sponsorships](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/trade/)  

With the permaweb expanding continuously, this list will be regularly updated as more apps integrate with the UCM.
