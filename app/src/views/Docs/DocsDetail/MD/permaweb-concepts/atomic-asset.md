# What is an atomic asset?

An atomic asset is a unique digital item stored on Arweave. “Atomic” means that the identifier for the data of the transaction is the same identifier for the contract. Unlike traditional NFTs, the asset data is uploaded together with a smart contract in a single transaction which is inseparable and does not rely on external components.

On other chains, the asset data, metadata, and smart contract are typically separate from each other with the smart contract linking to the other components. Atomic assets ensure that all data is stored together onchain to ensure permanence and accessibility.
