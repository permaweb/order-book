## Atomic asset

An atomic asset is a unique digital item stored on Arweave. Unlike traditional NFTs, the asset data is uploaded together with a smart contract in a single transaction which is inseparable and does not rely on external components.

On other chains, the asset data, metadata, and smart contract are typically separate from each other with the smart contract linking to the other components. Atomic assets ensure that all data is stored together onchain to ensure permanence and accessibility.

### Atomic asset collections

Atomic asset collections are groups of atomic assets bundled together and displayed as a collection on the UCM. These collections can consist of existing atomic assets owned by the user, newly uploaded assets, or a combination of both.
