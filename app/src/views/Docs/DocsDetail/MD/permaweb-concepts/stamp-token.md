# What are Stamps and Stamp tokens ($STAMP)?

Stamps serve as the universal “like” button on the permaweb. With a vouched wallet, users can support content by stamping it, rewarding both content creators and stampers with $STAMP tokens daily. Essentially, you earn rewards for creating accessible content on the permaweb that the community appreciates and endorses.

Explore how Stamps revolutionize content creation and online incentives in the [Stamps protocol wiki](https://stamps.arweave.dev/#/en/main).

Check out how many $STAMP tokens you have [here](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/asset/TlqASNDLA1Uh8yFiH-BzR_1FDag4s735F3PoUFEv2Mo).
