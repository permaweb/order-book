# Get vouched

To ensure a quality permaweb experience, we employ a decentralized verification process. VouchDAO allows individuals to “vouch” for an Arweave address, verifying its identity and humanity. Being vouched grants access to additional permaweb features like receiving $PIXL and $STAMP tokens.

Get “vouched” through X [here](https://vouch-twitter.arweave.dev/#/).
