# What is the Universal Data License (UDL)?

The Universal Data License defines the terms and conditions for using media assets on the permaweb. The UDL establishes a framework for licensing digital media such as images, videos, audio, graphics and more.

Instead of platforms setting the terms and conditions, on the permaweb creators define how their media can be utilized. The following UDL licensing parameters are integrated into BazAR and can be easily set by content creators:

**Public use**: Allows anyone to copy and distribute assets.

**Derivation**: Content with a derivation tag indicates that content can be used based its usage parameters indicated on the asset page.

**Commercial use**: Content owners may use the content to advertise, market or sell a product.
