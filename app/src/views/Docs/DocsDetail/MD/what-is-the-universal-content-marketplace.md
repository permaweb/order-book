# What is the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol?

The Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) is a revolutionary protocol built on the permaweb, specifically designed to enable trustless exchange of atomic assets. It empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications. BazAR is the first permaweb app built using the UCM protocol.
